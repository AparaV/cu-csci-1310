'''
This is how you comment in python

Python - Dynamic Typing - type assigned at run time;
	This is because it is an interpreted language;
C++ - Static Typing;
	Compiled language;

Loops have iterators - iterate over a collection - maybe ints, lines in file, characters in string;

Functions are not necessary in python
C++ needs a main function

Python - indentation
C++ - braces

Variables
	int
	float
	string
	bool
	list - array with different types in same variable
	tuple - read only list
	dictionary
